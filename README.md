## LinearReg
simple linear regression modal, with an implementation of gradient descent.

## MultipleLinearReg 
another linear regression modal but it works with multiple features (with updated gradient descent to work with multiple features, feature scalling and vectorization, and test to see if gradient descent will converge). It builds upon the orginal linear regression modal. 

## LogisitcRegression 
logisitc regession modal that implements gradient descent with regularization(addressing overfitting). The code also implements feature scalling, vectorazation, test to see if gradient descent will converge, and plotting the decision boundry.
